>_"Our job as builders is to create the world as it could be."_ - <a href="https://farmerandfarmer.org/mastery/builder.html" target="_blank">Sep Kamvar</a>

As developers, we have the opportunity to build the technology that defines the future. Our time and effort should be focused on solving complex problems and masterful engineering.

- Imagine a _developer experience_ where everything you need sits right with you without the need for context switching between different platforms and environments to get tasks done.
- Imagine having _consistent standards_ of how products operate, communicate and integrate with each other, allowing you to seamlessly adopt anything across an ecosystem without spending hours in obscure documentation and the toil of attempting to integrate it in your code.
- Imagine being part of a _community_ that shares this vision and are constantly innovating on new tools and knowledge to enable the entire community to realise the vision.
- Imagine having new _incentive models_ for adding value to the community rather than simply receiving a 👏 while others make money off your contributions.

These are but a few things we are striving to realise with **alis.exchange**. We believe that as you join the community, and come build with us, that you would see the value of the exchange for yourself.

Before you get there, we have put together these onboarding resources to get you building as soon as possible. As part of the process, we will provide you with the resources to:
1. Help configure your developer environment;
2. Understand the foundational concepts and technologies used on **alis.exchange**; and
3. Help you build your first product.

The content is put together for you to move at your own pace. We have also done our best at synthesising information for each topic for you to know what is required to get going. Each section may have additional resources that you can refer to for more in-depth information. These resources can also be returned to at a later date for reference.

We look forward to have you part of the community!
