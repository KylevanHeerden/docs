# Build your first product 👷‍

> 👉 Now for the exciting part - actually getting to the code. In this section, you will build your first product on
> **alis.exchange** to get a feel for how everything you have installed and read comes together.

A few final things before we get started:
1. 👀 This section assumes you have successfully [configured your device](/DeviceConfiguration.md). If you had any
   troubles, check out our community Q&A for help.
2. This example is still a work in progress and still requires quite a bit of content. If anything obvious is missing
   or incorrect, please either post in our Discussions, or submit a pull request with the fixes.
3. This example attempts to structure content in a way that provides:
	- 🎥 **Context** - the story we are following and what we aim to achieve.
	- 🏃‍♂ **Execution** - the actual things that you will need to do.
	- 🤓 **Breakdown** - an explanation on what you did and what happened in the background.
4. The following onboarding section will provide a detailed breakdown of everything that you did in this example so
   don't worry if you are not fully comprehending what is happening when you execute the steps - all will come together.

Let's go!
